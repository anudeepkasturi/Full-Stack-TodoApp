Taskable is a full-stack web application cloned from Remember The Milk. It allows users to organize their todo lists with a friendly and intuitive user experience. It is built on a Ruby on Rails backend, a Postgres RDBMS and a React/Redux frontend.

## Features

### Secure Signup & User Authentication
Taskable allows you to create an account to save all of your personal data, but feel free to use the guest login to take a quick tour.
